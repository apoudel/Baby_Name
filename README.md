# Baby_Name
Visualization in D3 that lets users enter baby names and compare them to see how they've changed over the ages.

To use: Open the files (it is suggest that you open it through a simple python server, but double clicking is fine too). Enter names and select gender to get them graphed. Double click on the names to remove them.
